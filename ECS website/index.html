		<p class="p1">Hollow knight is a very fun game but it does take some time and paitence.</p>
		<p class="p2">Once you give it time it becomes a really fun game (and maybe your favorite :3)</p>
		<h2>Now, what are the steps?</h2>
		<p class="p3">The very beginning of the game is very boring and simple, but don't let that discourage you!</p>
		<p class="p4">Now once you get past the tutorial, you'll find yourself in a dark, gloomy, and nearly deserted town called Dirtmouth, but remember this is just the beginning!</p>

		<p class="p5">After you enter Dirtmouth and go down the well into the cave systems, you finally get to combat system! (yayyy)</p>
		<p class="p6">To be frank, it's a VERY VERY boring game when you start, everything is basic and it seems that 15 dollars you spent on it was pointless</p>
		<p class="p7">And you might look like this when you begin</p>

		<h3>Consider this section and the other sections below this a "Beginners Guide"</h3>
		<p class="p9">Even though these little flying $&@¿s don't appear until much later in the game, AVOID THEM!!!!!!!</p>

		<p class="p10">THESE LITTLE SADISTIC GREMLINS WILL DO NOTHING BUT TRY TO KILL YOU IN COLD BLOOD AND PLEASURE</p>
		<p class="p11">I HATE THEM, I HATE PRIMAL ASPIDS SO MUCH. HATE THEM, HATE THEM WITH ME</p>
		<p class="p12">Once you get this charm, use it, like it's really good</p>
